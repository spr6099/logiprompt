        The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered
        road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz
        designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered
        automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile
        for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl
        Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely
        available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by
        the masses was the Ford Model T, begun in 1908, an American car
        manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the
        US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other
        parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after
        World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the
        developed economy.
