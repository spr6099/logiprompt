(\*)Use State
useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

(\*) Use Effect
The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in your functional components, such as
fetching data, subscribing to external events, or manually changing the DOM. It combines the
functionality of componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate , and componentWillUnmount in class
components.

useEffect is one of the most important hooks in react and is a way to handle life cycle of the
component in which it is present. useEffect runs on every render of the
component (i.e when a state variable changes) and can also run every time a specific value changes
that is mentioned in it's dependency array

(\*)UseRef
The main use of useRef hook is to access the DOM elements in a more efficient way as compared to
simple refs. Since useRef hooks preserve value across various re-renders and do not cause
re-renders whenever a value is changed they make the application faster and helps in caching and
storing previous values

(\*) Fetch
The Fetch API provides a fetch() method defined on the window object. It also provides a JavaScript
interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline (requests and responses). The
fetch method has one mandatory argument- the URL of the resource to be fetched. This method
returns a Promise that can be used to retrieve the response to the request.

(\*)Axios  
Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the
browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP
requests and responses and enables client-side protection against XSRF. It also has the ability to
cancel requests.

(\*) Cors
In ReactJS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS requests refers to the method that allows you to make requests to the server deployed at a different domain. As a reference, if the frontend and backend are at two different domains, we need CORS there.

(\*) onSubmit Event
React onSubmit is an event handler that triggers when a form is submitted. It is one of the form events that sends the input data to the (handleSubmit) function to utilize that information.
